# README

## Get started

You need docker installed on your system. Run `docker compose up` to boot the application.
Docker compose is used to mount current dir to `/app` in the container, so that state is
preserved between reboots.

### Migrate the database

    docker exec -it challenge-app-1 bundle exec rails db:migrate

## Usage

This is Rails API-only app. It runs on port 3000. Open your favourite networking client to
interact with it. Interactive API documentation is available on http://localhost:3000/api-docs

The available endpoints are:

* `POST /api/v1/patients.json` - creates a new patient
* `POST /api/v1/injections.json` - create a new injection record
* `GET /api/v1/injections.json` - view injection records
* `GET /api/v1/patients/adherence_score.json` - get the adherence score for a patient
